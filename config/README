If you have the Voyager holdings information configuration file(s) with correct
credentials and settings, you can put the file(s) here and it/they will be
copied inside the virtual machine during the provisiong. Also, the
MultiBackend.ini file will be modified based on the file name(s).

The file name(s) should follow the pattern 'VoyagerRestful_orgname.ini'.
Some examples:
    - VoyagerResful_jykdok.ini,
    - VoyagerRestful_helka.ini or
    - VoyagerRestful_oula.ini

Alternatively you can copy the file(s) manually to
vufind2/local/config(/vagrant)/vufind/ and adjust the MultiBackend.ini in
vufind2/local/config(/vagrant)/finna directory.
